I was curious to know more about the groups that actually guide these technologies
that impact millions of peoples’ lives.  The World Wide Web Consortium — <em>W<!-- -->3<!-- -->C</em> for short — is one of these groups, responsible for codifying a set of standards for the web.
Along with ECMA International, a standards body to created to oversee the development of JavaScript (ECMAScript is the ES in <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a>), the W3C creates proposals that are
standardized and adopted by browsers.</p><p>The W3C is split up into working groups, which consist of invited experts and representatives from member organizations. There are <span>309</span> organizations with members across <span>41</span> working groups. Most of the organizations are private companies, but there are some universities and non-profits as well.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the most well-represented organizations are browser manufacturers like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, Baidu, and Alibaba. Other tech giants like Adobe, IBM, and Intel are represented too. To help better understand what these companies are most interested in, I built a small interactive tool to browse organizations and see what groups their representatives are working with.</p><hr/><p><em>Click on the name of an organization to see its membership breakdown, and use the control panel to refine your search and see more or fewer organizations. Scroll down for methodology.</em>

This data was obtained from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C website</a> in April 2018. Some organizations were listed as being members of a group but having no current representatives, in this case they were given a value of 0.5 representatives. The group size totals reflect the total number of organizational members, not including invited experts, whose participation is not affiliated with a specific organization.</p><p>The member groups are sized according the selected organization’s level of participation in each group. The layout is calculated by <a href="https://github.com/eiriklv/react-masonry-component">react-masonry-component</a>, which although
imperfect, provides a good at-a-glance overview of each organization’s major interests. If you’d like to visualize this data in a different way, feel free to take it from the github repo linked below, in the <code>data</code> folder.</p><h3>Links</h3><ul><li>This article was created with <a href="https://idyll-lang.org">Idyll</a>, a markup language for interactive articles.</li><li>The source and data is available for download <a href="https://github.com/mathisonian/who-shapes-the-open-web">here</a>.</li></ul></div></div></div>
